# Third Year Mobile Applications Development Project built using c# and visual studio 2015

## Weather App

This repository contains code and information for my third year project for the module Mobile Applications 2 
That I am currently undertaking.


## Project Overview

Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP) that will each demonstrate the use of Isolated Storage and at least one other 
sensor or service available on the devices. These include:  Accelerometer or Gyroscope  GPS (Location Based Services)
 Sound  Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc)  Camera  Multi Touch Gesture Management

The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose and an answer to the question “why will the user open 
this app for a second time?” cause its class

## Submission Requirement:

Your App must be submitted for certification on the Windows Store in order to be considered for marking

## About App

The App that I chose to create using Windows UWP is a simple Weather App
