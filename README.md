# Third Year Mobile Applications Development Project built using c# and visual studio 2015

## Weather App

This repository contains code and information for my third year project for the module Mobile Applications 2 
That I am currently undertaking.


## Project Overview

Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP) that will each demonstrate the use of Isolated Storage and at least one other 
sensor or service available on the devices. These include:  Accelerometer or Gyroscope  GPS (Location Based Services)
 Sound  Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc)  Camera  Multi Touch Gesture Management

The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose and an answer to the question “why will the user open 
this app for a second time?” 

## Submission Requirement:

App must be submitted for certification on the Windows Store in order to be considered for marking

## About App

The App that I chose to create using Windows UWP is a simple Weather App, I decided to make this app different, I decided to make the app for only galway with up to date weather, my idea is for this to be amed at the farming sector, for when famer are making hay in the summer mounths. to produce best qualty hay you need weather to be above 20 degrees for it to be turned and dry quicker. when its below 20 degrees the famer know to stop turning the hay. I feel this app will be used many times over the summer mounts.
